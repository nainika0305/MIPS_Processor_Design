# MIPS_Processor_Design
This repository contains the implementation for Assignment 2 of the EG 212 Computer Architecture course i took in semester 2. The assignment involves writing MIPS assembly code for various programs and implementing a non-pipelined MIPS processor in Python. The primary focus is on understanding MIPS architecture and instruction execution.

The following programs have been implemented in MIPS assembly language:

1. Finding the Factorial of a Number:
This program computes the factorial of a given integer using iterative logic.

2. Sorting an Array Using Selection Sort:
This program sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.

3. Searching a Number in an Array Using Binary Search:
This program performs a binary search to find a specified number within a sorted array.


**Report**: contains the report (PDF) documenting the assignment details, including explanations, assumptions, and results.


**Instructions to Run -**
Assembly Code Execution: Use the MARS MIPS Assembler to assemble and run the provided assembly programs.

Processor Simulation: Run the mips_processor.py script to simulate the execution of the machine code.
